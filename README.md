# VirtualTourist

Tour the world without leaving the comforts of your couch: drop as many pins as you like into the map by long pressing anywhere and upon clicking on then you're taken into another view with random flickr photos of this location. Visited locations images will persist in memory to prevent reload and save data consumption.

## Getting Started

All that's required for this project to run is Xcode 8.3.3+ and an internet connection.

## Contribute

Feel free to fork the code, add some interesting new feature and make the proper pull request. I'll be more than happy to review it.
