# VirtualTourist

Virtual toursit app for iOS Nanodegree's Udacity. You can drop as many links as you like into the map by long pressing anywhere (even **dragging** them if you're not about where they landed in the first place) and upon clicking on then you're taken into another screen with random flickr photos of this location. All of this is persistent in Core Data so after initial download all the app functionality remains even _without_ any internet connection.
